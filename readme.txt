Thumblink automatically generates thumbnails for every page on your website to make your links look better.

== Description ==
Thumblink automatically creates thumbnails for all of your blog posts to make your links look better. A link to your WordPress site on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn is often the first interaction you have with a visitor.

Every link's thumbnail is 3x larger than its text preview - if it looks ugly or unmaintained, your page loses a potential visitor. Thumblink automatically generates these thumbnails by taking a screenshot of each page.

The Thumblink WordPress plugin relies on the [Thumblink](https://thumblink.com) service in order to generate thumbnails. Please read Thumblink's [TOS](https://thumblink.com/tos) and [Privacy Policy](https://thumblink.com/privacy) prior to installation.

== Installation ==
After activating the Thumblink WordPress plugin, your visitors will see generated thumbnails for each of your pages when they encounter your website on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, iMessage etc. Sign up for an account on Thumblink.com for additional features.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
__How long does a Thumblink take to generate?__
Usually within 10 seconds of the initial request, but this may change based on the level of traffic. After generation, the Thumblink is saved and cached for subsequent requests.

__What happens if Thumblink generation fails?__
Failures can happen if there are issues with our servers loading your website. The failed Thumblink will be retried the next time it is requested.

__Do Thumblinks expire?__
Thumblinks do not expire, but you can always delete or regenerate them.

__Can I regenerate a Thumblink?__
Yes, you can do this from the Thumblink Account UI.
